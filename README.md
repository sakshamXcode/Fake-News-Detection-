# 📰 Fake News Detection App

## 🌟 Introduction
The **Fake News Detection App** is a machine learning-powered tool designed to identify and classify news articles as *fake* or *real*. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the app helps combat the spread of misinformation in today's digital age.

## 💡 Features
- Upload or input news articles for analysis.
- Provides a detailed classification of the article (*Fake* or *Real*).
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- High accuracy with an ML model trained on diverse datasets.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The input text is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into numerical features.
2. **Model Prediction**: The processed text is analyzed using a pre-trained machine learning model.
3. **Result**: The app outputs whether the news is *Fake* or *Real* on the Terminal.... (If we are lucky I shall be able to make Streamlit work to produce an output on the UI).

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, Javascript
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - Numpy, Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) (or specify your source)
